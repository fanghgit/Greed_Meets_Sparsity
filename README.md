Experimental code for the paper "Greed Meets Sparsity: Understanding and
Improving Coordinate Descent for Sparse Optimization".

See the jupyter notebook `experiments.ipynb` for reproducing some important experimental results, note that some experiments may take
quite a long time to run (more than 10 minutes) since we didn't fully
optimize the code for practical purpose.
